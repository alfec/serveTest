This project was created to test the API and user interface of ServeTest.

Here you can clone the repository and use the `npm install` command to install all dependencies. Node.js version 16 or higher is required.

In this project, I used Cypress with PageObject and some custom commands. The tests were separated between UI and API, and the reports are generated by Mochawesome.
Here we have a draft of a jenkinsfile, this should do the basic config to run this project on jenkins CI/CD

Steps to run the project are:
- git clone "https://github.com/alfec/serveTest.git"
- cd serveTest
- npm install
- npx cypress open
